Berklea first discovered her love for performing when she stepped onto The St. Louis MUNY stage as Young Kim in Showboat at the age of 7. 

She went on to perform in the national tour of Irving Berlin's White Christmas as Susan Waverly at the age of 10 and has not looked back since.

She has returned to the St. Louis MUNY in the summers, including the summer of 2018 when she performed as Kathy Selden opposite Corbin Bleu in the beloved musical Singin' in the Rain.

Berklea has performed at professional theaters throughout the country, including Goodspeed Opera House, Paper Mill Playhouse, and Theatre Under the Stars in Houston.

In New York City, Berklea performed in High Button Shoes at City Center, Encores! She also performed in The Actors Fund's 15th Anniversary Reunion Concert for Broadway's Thoroughly Modern Millie at the Minskoff Theatre in 2018.

â€‹Berklea has recently discovered her love for choreography. She also enjoys her time outside of the theater practicing gymnastics, tennis, completing the Advanced Level 7 Cecchetti Council of America ballet examination, and becoming a certified Vinyasa Yoga instructor. She is a dedicated performer and she is excited to see what the future may hold.
